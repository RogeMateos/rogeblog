1. **Unit Test**: Testing individual components or functions (e.g., ensuring the page renders correctly or a button click triggers the right action).
2. **Integration Test**: Testing how different components interact on the page.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Test**: Testing the entire user flow, such as navigating to the new page and interacting with its features.
4. **Visual Regression Test**: Ensuring the page layout and design remain consistent.

Also, let me know if you're using a specific testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress) so I can tailor the test code to your setup!
